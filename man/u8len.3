.Fn u8len "const char8_t *s" "size_t n"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn u8len
function returns the number of UTF-8 encoded Unicode codepoints in the
buffer
.Fa s
of length
.Fa n
bytes.
.Pp
Invalid bytes are interpreted as having a length of 1 byte.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn u8len
function returns the number of codepoints in the buffer
.Fa s .
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following call to
.Fn u8len
will return 17 while the call to
.Fn strlen
will return 22 as a result of use of multibyte-characters in
.Fa s .

.Sh CAVEATS
The return value of
.Fn u8len
does not necessarily represent the number of human-preceived characters
in the given buffer;
multiple codepoints may combine to form one human-preceived character
that spans a single column.
To count user-preceived codepoints
.Pq also known as graphemes ,
you may want to use the
.Xr u8gcnt 3
function.
